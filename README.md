##  About Me

I'm an Information Technology student at George Mason University, focusing on Cybersecurity. I've been into tech since I was a kid. I was always into fixing computers, helping friends and family with their tech problems, and tweaking  with my home network just to see how things work.  That curiosity eventually turned into a real passion for cybersecurity, and now I'm working toward helping protect systems from online threats.
