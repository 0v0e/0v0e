## 🔍 About Me

I'm a passionate Information Technology student at George Mason University, concentrating in Cybersecurity. My journey into technology began in childhood, troubleshooting networks and resolving tech issues for friends and family. I also began  experimenting with my home network — simulating traffic congestion, running stress tests, and safely isolating environments to understand how systems respond under pressure. This early fascination evolved into a dedicated pursuit of cybersecurity, aiming to protect systems from unseen threats.
